## Introductory Objectives by Dave.

To grow Interact RDT's client base beyond South Africa, targeting the banking,
insurance, and telecom sectors in primarily English-speaking countries. The
focus will be on C-Suite executives and senior managers of large enterprises and
medium-to-large companies that employ at least 500 people.

The campaign should focus on the facts that after successfully servicing the
South African market for 20 years, we have made the decision to globalise the
business as we believe that there is an opportunity to deliver world-class UX,
CX and Market Research solutions to international client at a fraction of their
cost, enabling them to stretch their budgets much further. We will focus
initially on locations that have similar timezones to South Africa, meaning
there would be no inconvenience to clients in respect of time zones either.

The goal of the mails should be to get recipients to click on a link to direct
them to a calendar booking page for a no-obligation, 15-minute discovery call
with one of our representatives to ensure they are a fit for our business and to
ensure that our business is a good fit for them. Assuming we then agree to move
forward, we would take some time to prepare a bespoke approach for the client
which would then be delivered in a 45-minute demo call. The objective of this
call would be to sign clients up.

If recipients feel they need more info before they commit, then we'll direct
them to a lnading page that will give them more info on use, some actual case
studies from clients and more supporting content. they'll also be able to book
the discovery call there.
