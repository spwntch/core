## Interact RDT Outbound Linkedin Messagiing Campaign

When considering lead time between LinkedIn messages, we want to strike a
balance between being persistent and respecting the prospect's time. Being
overly aggressive can turn a potential lead off, while being too passive might
make you miss an opportunity.

In total, we'd be spreading your messaging over about 16 days, which is a
little over two weeks. This provides a nice balance of consistent communication
without being overwhelming. However, always remember to be flexible. If the
prospect is engaging with us actively, adjust your timings based on their
responsiveness.

**Message**:

> Hi [Prospect Name], I've been diving deep into the [banking/insurance/telecom]
> sector, and your profile stood out. As someone who's also committed to
> operational efficiencies and data-driven solutions, I'd love to connect and
> exchange insights. - Dave from Interact RDT

**Notes**:

- Once the connection request is sent, wait for the prospect to accept. This can
  vary but generally, if they haven't accepted within a week, it might be a good
  idea to consider moving on or trying a different approach.

### 2. Introductory Message

**Message**:

> Thank you for connecting, [Prospect Name]. I understand the unique challenges
> and aspirations in the [banking/insurance/telecom] sector, particularly in
> enhancing customer experience while keeping operational costs in check. I've
> got some insights that might resonate with you. Would a brief chat be of
> interest? - Dave

**Notes**:

- Send this immediately after they accept your connection request. You're fresh
  in their mind, and it's a great opportunity to start a conversation.

### 3. Industry Challenges & Solution Message

**Message**:

> Hello [Prospect Name], enhancing operational efficiency is an ongoing
> challenge for many in our industry. We recently worked on a project addressing
> similar concerns with innovative solutions. I'd be keen to share some of our
> findings and see if they align with your goals. Does that sound worthwhile? -
> Dave

**Lead Time**:

- 4 days after the Introductory Message.

**Notes**:

- You've given them a few days to consider your initial message. The subsequent
  message should be more tailored towards understanding their challenges and
  offering solutions.

### 4. Social Proof Message

**Message**:

> Hi [Prospect Name], a recent collaboration with [Brand/Client] led to them
> achieving significant cost-savings without compromising on quality. I believe
> these results are replicable for [Company Name] as well. If this aligns with
> your goals, let's discuss further. - Dave

**Lead Time**:

- 7 days after the Industry Challenges & Solution Message.

**Notes**:

- Providing a week after the previous message is respectful. With the Social
  Proof message, you're offering evidence of how you've helped similar
  professionals or companies in the past.

### 5. Reminder & Urgency Message

**Message**:

> Hello [Prospect Name], I truly believe there's an opportunity for us to
> collaborate and unlock value for [Company Name]. I'm here to provide insights
> and tailored solutions, without any sales jargon. Please let me know if you're
> interested in a value-based conversation. - Dave

**Lead Time**:

- 5 days after the Social Proof Message.

**Notes**:

- This message acts as a gentle nudge to reignite their interest. It's not too
  far from the Social Proof message, creating a sense of urgency.
